# parsicore — Persian Rust Ecosystem Tools

Welcome to **parsicore**, the powerhouse organization dedicated to building top-notch Rust tools for Persian developers.

## Who We Are

At parsicore, we understand that Persian developers deserve native, reliable, and efficient libraries tailored specifically to their unique needs — especially when it comes to date and time handling. That’s why we focus on creating **Rust crates** that make working with the Persian calendar and related utilities seamless and intuitive.

## Our Mission

To empower the Persian Rust community with **robust**, **high-performance**, and **easy-to-use** tools — bridging the gap between international programming standards and local cultural needs.

- **Persian Calendar Tools**  
  Create, convert, and manipulate Persian (Solar Hijri) dates effortlessly with our core crates.  
- **Date Conversion Crates**  
  Seamless conversion between Persian and Gregorian calendars with high accuracy.  
- **Utility Libraries**  
  Formatting, parsing, and additional utilities that simplify date/time management in Persian contexts.  
- **CLI and GUI Tools** (coming soon)  
  Command-line interfaces and graphical frontends to make Persian calendar tasks accessible for all skill levels.
